 I have been engaged in professional activities in the field of IT, telephony, videoconferencing for more than 20 years. Over the past 5 years, I have been intensively engaged in programming, as this allows me to optimize part of the processes, as well as to optimize and improve user experience. During my professional career, I have implemented and overseen a large number of projects related to the introduction of new technologies, modernization of equipment, and optimization of processes.

*My goal is to find a new job, possibly through a career change.*
